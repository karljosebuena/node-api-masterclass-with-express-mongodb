# Node API Masterclass with Express & Mongodb

## Real world backend for a bootcamp directory app

This is a project based course where we build an extensive, in-depth backend API for DevCamper, a bootcamp directory app. We will start from scratch and end up with a professional deployed API with documentation. We will dive deep into Node, Express and MongoDB. Here is some of what you will learn in this course and project.

## Takeaway from the project
* Real World Backend RESTful API For Bootcamp Directory App
* HTTP Fundamentals (Req/Res Cycle, Status Codes, etc)
* Advanced Mongoose Queries
* JWT/Cookie Authentication
* Express & Mongoose Middleware (Geocoding, Auth, Error Handling, etc)
* API Security (NoSQL injection, XSS protection, Rate Limiting)
* API Documentation & Deployment
